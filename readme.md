## Project Overview

Hey there! Welcome to the Fishkapp Project! This project allows you to easily create, edit, and delete fishkapps. These fishkapps are stored in both an external API and a database, creating a central and efficient system for managing them. The project started during some free time in the https://www.nerdbord.io/ community. We were given the design and tasks to work on, and I decided to take on the responsibility of developing the entire project on my own. Plus, my code went through a detailed review process, where Jakub and AI gave helpful feedback during the pull request evaluation.
